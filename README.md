# Node TypeScript Setup and debugging

This project is setup to teach how to setup a node project with typescript.

Aditionally we may cover:
- How NPM uses `package.json` and the difference between commonjs and modules.
- The difference between `dependencies`, `devDependencies` and `peerDependencies`
- How to setup scripts in your `package.json` file
- What `package-lock.json` is used for
- What is `tsconfig.json` and how to use that
- VSCode's `.vscode` folder and it's `launch.json`
- (bonus) setting up other packages like `nodemon`, `vitest`, `eslint` and `prettier`

## Assignments

In the assignments directory there are a few folders. For the purpose of learning, I'd like to treat each folder as a separate project where we can walk through each stage of this.
