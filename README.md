# Node TypeScript Setup and debugging

This project is setup to teach how to setup a node project with typescript and use the debugger in VSCode

- 01 Node without package.json
- 02 Setting up `package.json` and creating scripts
- 03 installing dependencies and the `package-lock.json` file.
- 04 quick difference between `npx` and `npm` and running a `typescript` file
- 05 `tsconfig.json` for typescript
- 06 debugging in JavaScript and `.vscode` folder and it's `launch.json`
- 07 setting up debugger for TypeScript.

Aditionally we may cover:
- (bonus) setting up other packages like `nodemon`, `vitest`, `eslint` and `prettier`

## Assignments

In the assignments directory there are a few folders. For the purpose of learning, I'd like to treat each folder as a separate project where we can walk through each stage of this.
